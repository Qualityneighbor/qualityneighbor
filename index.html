        June in Texas means your garden’s thirstier than a ranch hand at high noon. It’s time to sharpen your watering routine and soil soaking. If it’s one per chance—think mulching! Mulch ke[...]

  <section class="card card-heat">
    <h3><span class="icon">&#128293;</span> Beat the Heat, Ranch-Style: Smart Moves for Hot Days</h3>
    <p>
      June in Central Texas brings crunch time, lake life, and ranch chores galore. Whether you're working the pond, chasing livestock, or enjoying a BBQ, staying cool can make a world of difference. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Time Your Activities Wisely:</b> Work or exercise during the cooler parts of the day. Avoid working at midday. And if sun-showers hit, it's a sign to rest and chill.</li>
      <li><b>Dress for the Heat:</b> Lightweight, light-colored, and moisture-wicking clothing. Protect kids from long-sleeve sun exposure. Wide-brimmed hats keep you shady.</li>
      <li><b>Stay Hydrated:</b> Hydrate before, during, and after physical activity. Ranchers know that “water is wealth.” Try adding a splash of citrus or electrolytes to replenish lost minerals.[...]
      <li><b>Take Regular Breaks:</b> Chores should never mean exhaustion. Set a timer so you rest pockets. This is especially important for pets, too!</li>
      <li><b>Know the Signs of Heat-Related Wellness:</b> Watch for symptoms: excessive sweating, fatigue, and rapid heart rate. If you or a child feel faint, seek medical attention if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
